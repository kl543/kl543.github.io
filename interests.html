<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>
  I grew up as an experimentalist (MBE growth + STM measurement), and that work
  heavily trained my coding: device control, automated data pipelines, and
  simulation. I’m now intentionally pivoting to <b>AI/ML</b> and
  <b>large-scale data processing</b>, while formalizing the math and CS
  foundations behind them. I’m a fast, self-directed learner and enjoy turning
  messy experimental data into clear, reproducible results.

<h3>Focus Areas</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Numerical methods &amp; <b>optimization</b> (convex/non-convex), inverse problems, uncertainty modeling</li>
  <li><b>Probability &amp; statistics</b>: estimation, hypothesis testing, Bayesian reasoning, Monte Carlo</li>
  <li><b>Time-series &amp; spectral analysis</b>: FFT/CWT, AR/ARIMA, state-space models, system identification</li>
  <li><b>Machine learning</b>: feature engineering, tree/boosting and linear models, regularization, model selection</li>
  <li><b>Scientific computing</b> in Python: vectorized NumPy/SciPy, efficient Pandas, profiling, and testing</li>
  <li>Reproducible pipelines: data versioning, configuration-driven runs, logging, and automation</li>
</ul>

<h3>Currently Studying</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Linear algebra, numerical optimization, probability &amp; statistics, and stochastic processes</li>
  <li>Data structures &amp; algorithms, software design/testing, and scalable data handling</li>
</ul>
